	<h4 class="title title--h4 first-title">Search Internship Feb. 2024</h4>
	<p>I am a computer science student aiming to become a developer in the future, with a strong preference for backend. A developer is not someone who repairs computers, you know!</p>
	<p>Currently, I'm in my second year of computer school and I work in the restaurant industry on the side. I enjoy being alone or with the people I love. When I code, I often listen to music to help me focus on my work.</p>

					<p class="case-item__caption">HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a great language too, but I find that we quickly go through it because all HTML codes look alike. It all depends on the project, so I started with this language and I stick with it because I need to do HTML for the Backend, as in PHP, we include HTML.</p>

					<p class="case-item__caption">SQL (Structured Query Language) is very important, not only for creating databases but also for updating them or using them to display text, results, or many other things. It's useless without PHP for websites, and I find it very easy to use, well, almost ^^</p>

I've used Ubuntu, Debian, Kali, and many other distributions. I find that Linux is very comprehensive, and the commands in the shell aren't necessarily very difficult.</p>

He has always been punctual and diligent in his work, and he is a full-fledged member of our team, even though he works part-time. In the current period, finding a young person of his age who is as motivated to work and finance his studies is an asset, a strength, and a pleasure. I encourage Amaury to persevere in this path, and I will support him in his future projects.</p>
